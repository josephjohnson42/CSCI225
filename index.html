            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Greetings and welcome to my Website. 
                I trust that you will find that everything is in order and that there is nothing unusual about it at all. 
                Im Joseph, Im a computer science major, and I aspire to be a videogame designer. 
                Drawing is my preffered hobby, and when I am not doing that, I am either playing videogames or watching YouTube. 
                Being an aspiring designer, I of course have a planned out game for me to make, the only thing really holding it back at this point being a lack of experience and time. 
                Throughout this site one may come across various concept arts I am inclined to share with the outside world. 
                Hope you enjoy!
            </p>

                    <b>Unnamed Text-Based Adventure Game:</b> Project during my second year of college. My role was creating the combat which contained reactive battle dialog and enemies that can only be dealt with in a specific way. 
                    Skills for my section included writing skills, usage of enum variables, and skills with recursion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Unnamed Bus Route Finder:</b> Project during my second year of college. Roles were not clear since 2 of the 4 group members ended up doing a number of the sections without letting others participate. 
                    My role (until it got scrapped for a copy pasted ver from notes) was to design a routing program that implemented GUI elements and could access stored data in order to display a route and the costs associated with it. 
                    Skills for what I completed include skills with GUI, designing comprehensive UI, and data management.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Ongoing Project - Clockhand Character Art:</b> An ongoing project meant to capture the personalities and key moments of each main character in the upcoming project, Clockhand. 
                    Skills required include skills with acrylic paint, character designs, and color theory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Upcoming Project - Clockhand:</b> A lengthy skill based dash n slash platformer with an emphasis on speed and fun.
